For each of the three images, increment its property of times it has been shown by one.

Attach an event listener to the section of the HTML page where the images are going to be displayed.

Once the users ‘clicks’ a product, generate three new products for the user to pick from.
As a user, I would like to track the selections made by viewers so that I can determine which products to keep for the catalog.

After every selection by the viewer, update the newly added property to reflect if it was clicked.


As a user, I would like to view a report of results after all rounds of voting have concluded so that I can evaluate which products were the most popular.
Create a property attached to the constructor function itself that keeps track of all the products that are currently being considered.

After voting rounds have been completed, remove the event listeners on the product.

Add a button with the text View Results, which when clicked displays the list of all the products followed by the votes received, and number of times seen for each. Example: banana had 3 votes, and was seen 5 times.
