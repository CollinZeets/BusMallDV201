As a user, I would like to view a report of results after all rounds of voting have concluded so that I can evaluate which products were the most popular.

Create a property attached to the constructor function itself that keeps track of all the products that are currently being considered.

After voting rounds have been completed, remove the event listeners on the product.

Add a button with the text View Results, which when clicked displays the list of all the products followed by the votes received, and number of times seen for each. Example: banana had 3 votes, and was seen 5 times.
